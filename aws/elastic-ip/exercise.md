## AWS EC2 - Elastic IP 🌐

### Requirements
* An EC2 instance with a public IP (not an Elastic IP) 📝

### Objectives
1. Write down the public IP of your EC2 instance somewhere and stop & start the instance. Does the public IP address remain the same? 🤔 Why?
2. Handle this situation so you have the same public IP even after stopping and starting the instance 💡
